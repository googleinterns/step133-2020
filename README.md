STEP Capstone Project - Finscholar

There exists a significant gap in information that many high school students face when it 
comes to college financial aid and scholarships. Unfortunately, a lot of the information 
available is not easily accessible, locked behind a pay wall, or simply presented in a 
way that is difficult to understand. We'd like to increase the access and transparency of 
this information so that disadvantaged groups, such as minority, low-income, and 
first-generation students (in addition to everyone else) can apply to colleges with a 
greater knowledge of how to afford it. This is why we created Finscholar, a portal for 
information related to college financial aid and college-specific scholarships. We 
collected and stored this information and presented it in a way that is easy to 
navigate and digest.
