STEP Capstone Project - Finscholar

#Objective:

There exists a significant gap in information that many high school students face when it 
comes to college financial aid and scholarships. 

Unfortunately, a lot of the information 
available is not easily accessible, locked behind a pay wall, or simply presented in a 
way that is difficult to understand. 

We'd like to increase the access and transparency of 
this information so that disadvantaged groups, such as minority, low-income, and 
first-generation students (in addition to everyone else) can apply to colleges with a 
greater knowledge of how to afford it. 

This is why we created Finscholar, a portal for information related to college 
financial aid and college-specific scholarships. 

We collected and stored this information and presented it in a way that is easy to 
navigate and digest. 

#What we used:

We used soy closure templates, CSS, and JavaScript for our frontend. 

For the backend, we used Java servlets and Cloud Firestore as our database.

We built all of our components from scratch, without any third-party UI frameworks. 

We used Material Design Lite as our primary CSS source.
